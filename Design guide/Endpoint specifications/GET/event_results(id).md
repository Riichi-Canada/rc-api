# /event_results/{event_id}
Return results for a given event.

## Use cases
Event page, to show the event's results.

## URL parameters
N/A

## Request body
N/A

### Example calls
`https://riichi.ca/api/v1/event_results/2024-010011`

## Expected response
2025 scores should only appear if the result points to a registered player (`player_id` is defined).

If `placement` is negative (ex. `â€“2`), it indicates the player did not finish the tournament (disqualified or other).
